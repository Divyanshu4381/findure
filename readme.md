# 🚀 Findure – Your Gateway to Local Service Discovery

**Findure** is a smart, scalable, and location-based service discovery mobile app developed during my internship at [Riveyra Infotech Private Limited](https://riveyra.com). Built with the powerful **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React Native, Node.js), Findure connects users with nearby services effortlessly.
